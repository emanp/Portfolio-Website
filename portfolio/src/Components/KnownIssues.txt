1. Contact form not centered and styled
2. reused/retyped code in NavigationBar.js and Banner.js -> Is there a way to just use a shared function across components? (onClickContact)\
3. GitHub logo on home page is wayyy to small lmao\ and make it white/purple
4. Needs actual videos of the projects
5. Needs description in /Home
6. Provide feedback when "Send Message" is clicked / Thank the user in a new page(?)
7. Add Copyright -- Do I need to do anything other than put it on my website, like registering my website somewhere?


--FIXED--
- Needs portfolio
- Buttons in portfolio section are black -- df?
    - Make them look like the "Let's Connect" in the header
- Clicking on "logo" should lead to home
- Bottom of "Projects" tab -- Contact Me button does not redirect to /contact
-  onClick on contact buttons needs to redirect to "/contact"
- Remove "Welcome to my portfolio" from home page
- Remove LOGO from home
- Tab name is "react app" Change to "Eman P"
- Favicon is react symbol, change it to something else
