1. Contact form not centered and styled
2. onClick on contact buttons needs to redirect to "/contact"
4. reused/retyped code in NavigationBar.js and Banner.js -> Is there a way to just use a shared function across components? (onClickContact)\
5. Need Skills and Projects sections
6. GitHub logo on home page is wayyy to small lmao\ and make it white/purple
9. Bottom of "Projects" tab -- Contact Me button does not redirect to /contact

--FIXED--

- Buttons in portfolio section are black -- df?
    - Make them look like the "Let's Connect" in the header
- Clicking on "logo" should lead to home
