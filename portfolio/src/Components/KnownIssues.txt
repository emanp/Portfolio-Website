1. reused/retyped code in NavigationBar.js and Banner.js -> Is there a way to just use a shared function across components? (onClickContact)\
2. Once message is sent in Contact Form, redirect them to /Home
3. Add Copyright -- Do I need to do anything other than put it on my website, like registering my website somewhere?
4. Add "Check out more of my projects here!" At bottom of Projects section
5. Clicking on icons should open in another tab

--FIXED--
- Needs portfolio
- Buttons in portfolio section are black -- df?
    - Make them look like the "Let's Connect" in the header
- Clicking on "logo" should lead to home
- Bottom of "Projects" tab -- Contact Me button does not redirect to /contact
-  onClick on contact buttons needs to redirect to "/contact"
- Remove "Welcome to my portfolio" from home page
- Remove LOGO from home
- Tab name is "react app" Change to "Eman P"
- Favicon is react symbol, change it to something else
- Contact form not centered and styled
- GitHub logo on home page is wayyy to small lmao\ and make it white/purple
- Needs actual videos of the projects
