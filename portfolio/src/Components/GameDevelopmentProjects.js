            <h2>Apex Extinction</h2>
            <p>As an unnamed soldier, you venture throughout a post-apocalyptic Earth, collecting currency and power-ups while mowing down various kinds of enemies. Collect enough currency to buy air drops that support you in battle. Avoid hazards unique to each level that aim to stop you in your tracks! Survive for long enough and fight a boss to clear that level! </p>

            <p>Collaborated with a team of three developers to create a game inspired by Vampire Survivors using C# and Unity 2D. Our project involves designing and implementing game mechanics, user interfaces, and soundtracks. C# is utilized for script writing to develop game functionality and interactions. GitHub is used for collaboration with team members, version control, and code sharing. I worked on character movement, animations, attack mechanics, the startup menu, and one-third of the enemies as a whole.</p>
